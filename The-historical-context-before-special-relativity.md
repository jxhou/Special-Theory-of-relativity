## The Historical Context Before the Special Theory of Relativity

The idea that a principle of relativity applies to the properties of the physical world is very old: it certainly predates Newton and Galileo, but probably not as far back as Aristotle. 

What the principle of relativity essentially
states is the following:

The laws of physics take the same form in all frames of reference moving with constant velocity with respect to one another.

This is a statement that can be given a precise mathematical meaning: the laws of physics are expressed in terms of equations, and the form that these equations take in different reference frames moving with constant velocity with respect to one another can be calculated by use of transformation equations – the so-called Galilean transformation in the case of Newtonian relativity. The principle of relativity then requires that the transformed equations have exactly the same form in all frames of reference, in other words that the physical laws are the same in all frames of reference.

Thus, quite generally the principle of relativity means that it is not possible, by considering any physical process whatsoever, to determine whether or not one or the other of the frames of references is ‘in motion’.

This principle of relativity was accepted (in somewhat simpler form i.e. with respect to the mechanical behaviour of bodies) by Newton and his successors.

All laws of nature appear to have
expression in mathematical form, so what the principle of relativity can be understood as saying is that the equations describing a law of nature take the same mathematical form in all inertial frames of reference.

Galilean Transformation:
```
x = x' + v t', 
y = y', 
z = z'
and at the time 
t = t'
```

The general conclusion we can draw from all this is that:  
Newton’s Laws of motion are identical in all inertial frames of reference.
This is the Newtonian (or Galilean) principle of relativity, and was essentially accepted by all physicists, at least until the time when Maxwell put together his famous set of equations.

### Maxwell’s Equations and the Ether
Not unexpectedly, it was anticipated that the equations Maxwell derived should also obey the above Newtonian principle of relativity in the sense that Maxwell’s equations should also be the same in all inertial frames of reference. Unfortunately, it was found that this was not the case.
Maxwell’s equations were found to assume completely different forms in different inertial frames of reference.

The ether was a substance that was supposedly the medium in which light waves were transmitted in a way something like the way in which air carries sound waves. Consequently it was believed that the behaviour of light, in particular its velocity, as measured from a frame of reference moving relative to the ether would be different from its behaviour as measured from a frame of reference stationary with respect to the ether.

Another disscusion about Maxwell’s Equations (ref #2)
In 1865, Maxwell had unified electricity and magnetism by writing down his equations of electromagnetism. It was soon realized that these equations supported wave-like solutions in a region free of electrical charges or currents (such a region is called the
'vacuum'). Experiments by Hertz and others showed conclusively that these electromagnetic waves (of the right frequency) were to be identified with light. Thus, Maxwell's equations brought optics into its unified domain and, furthermore, predicted that light waves should propagate at a finite speed c (about 300,000 km/s) calculable from these equations. With their Newtonian ideas of absolute space and time firmly entrenched, most physicists thought that this speed was correct only in one special frame. This special frame was postulated to be in a state of absolute rest, and it was thought that electromagnetic waves were supported by an unseen medium called the ether, which is at rest in this frame. 

With this picture in mind, it is clear that if the Earth moves with respect to this special frame at a velocity V, then the speed of light 'with respect to the Earth can take any value from c -|v| to c + |v|, depending on the particular direction of v. This is indeed our intuitive understanding of how two velocities add. For example, if two objects have speeds V1 and V2 with respect to some
fixed frame, then we expect that their relative speed will be V1 - V2 if they are moving in the same direction, and V1 + V2 if they are moving in opposite directions. We have developed this 'intuition' based on our everyday experiences, and we have a gut feeling that it is correct.
However, we will see below that the correct relativistic law of 'addition of velocities' is somewhat different. 

### The Galilean transformation
In Ref 3, a four-dimensional space-time coordinate system (t; x; y; z) ; which we will sometimes write as (t; ~x). And using the displacement representation of events to illustrate the Galilean transformation formulas. Neat.

### Michelson and Morley experiment:  
There were thus several attempts to detect the presence of this hypothetical ether or to show that the speed of light was frame dependent. The most famous experiment was done in 1887 by A A Michelson and E W Morley. They used an interferometer t~ study the speed of light along different directions and at different times of the year (when the orbital velocity of the Earth pointed along different directions). They concluded that the speed of light with respect to the Earth is always the same and does not depend on the relative motion of the Earth and the light wave. This observation proved that Maxwell's equations are valid in all (inertial) frames, and that there is no need to hypothesize a medium called the ether which is at rest in one preferred frame. 

It now seems obvious that, if Maxwell's equations had to retain their validity in all inertial frames, then our Newtonian notions of space and time need to be modified. However, while many of the best physicists of the time were aware of this inconsistency between Maxwell and Newton, it took almost two decades after the MichelsonMorley experiment and the genius of Einstein to come
up with the right modification to Newtonian mechanics.

Einstein make two postulates:
1. All the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference. This postulate implies that there is no experiment whether based on the laws of mechanics or the laws of electromagnetism from which it is possible to determine whether or not a frame of reference is in a state of uniform motion.
2. The speed of light is independent of the motion of its source.
