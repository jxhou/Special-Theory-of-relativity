## The Historical Background of the Special Theory of Relativity

### principle of relativity
The idea that a principle of relativity applies to the properties of the physical world is very old: it certainly predates Newton and seems to have been first stated concisely by Galileo, though some of the ideas were already around at the time of Aristotle (who apparently did not believe in the principle).

What the principle of relativity essentially
states is the following:

_The laws of physics take the same form in all frames of reference moving with constant velocity with respect to one another._

An equivalent statement of the principle, that is:

_Given two observers A and B moving at a constant velocity with respect to one another, it is not possible by any experiment whatsoever to determine which of the observers is ‘at rest’ or which is ‘in motion’._

This is a statement that can be given a precise mathematical meaning: the laws of physics are expressed in terms of equations, and the form that these equations take in different reference frames moving with constant velocity with respect to one another can be calculated by use of transformation equations – the so-called Galilean transformation in the case of Newtonian relativity. The principle of relativity then requires that the transformed equations have exactly the same form in all frames of reference, in other words that the physical laws are the same in all frames of reference.

Thus, quite generally the principle of relativity means that it is not possible, by considering any physical process whatsoever, to determine whether or not one or the other of the frames of references is ‘in motion’.

This principle of relativity was accepted (in somewhat simpler form i.e. with respect to the mechanical behavior of bodies) by Newton and his successors.

All laws of nature appear to have
expression in mathematical form, so what the principle of relativity can be understood as saying is that the equations describing a law of nature take the same mathematical form in all inertial frames of reference.

Galilean Transformation:
```
x = x' + v t', 
y = y', 
z = z'
and at the time 
t = t'
```

The general conclusion we can draw from all this is that:  
Newton’s Laws of motion are identical in all inertial frames of reference.
This is the Newtonian (or Galilean) principle of relativity, and was essentially accepted by all physicists, at least until the time when Maxwell put together his famous set of equations.

### Maxwell’s Equations and the Ether
In 1865, Maxwell had unified electricity and magnetism by writing down his equations of electromagnetism. It was soon realized that these equations supported wave-like solutions in vacuum. Experiments by Hertz and others showed conclusively that these electromagnetic waves (of the right frequency) were to be identified with light. Maxwell's equations brought optics into its unified domain
and, furthermore, predicted that light waves should propagate at a finite speed c (about 300,000 km/s) calculable from these equations. But relative to what? Maxwell’s theory did not specify any particular frame of reference for which light would have this speed.

Not unexpectedly, it was anticipated that the equations Maxwell derived should also obey the above Newtonian principle of relativity in the sense that Maxwell’s equations should also be the same in all inertial frames of reference. Unfortunately, it was found that this was not the case.
Maxwell’s equations were found to assume completely different forms in different inertial frames of reference. With their Newtonian ideas of absolute space and time firmly entrenched, most physicists thought that this speed was correct only in one special frame. This special frame was postulated
to be in a state of absolute rest, and it was thought that electromagnetic waves were supported by an unseen medium called the ether, which is at rest in this frame.

The ether was a substance that was supposedly the medium in which light waves were transmitted in a way something like the way in which air carries sound waves. Consequently it was believed that the behaviour of light, in particular its velocity, as measured from a frame of reference moving relative to the ether would be different from its behaviour as measured from a frame of reference stationary with respect to the ether.

Another discussion about Maxwell’s Equations (ref #2)
In 1865, Maxwell had unified electricity and magnetism by writing down his equations of electromagnetism. It was soon realized that these equations supported wave-like solutions in a region free of electrical charges or currents (such a region is called the 'vacuum'). Experiments by Hertz and others showed conclusively that these electromagnetic waves (of the right frequency) were to be identified with light. Thus, Maxwell's equations brought optics into its unified domain and, furthermore, predicted that light waves should propagate at a finite speed c (about 300,000 km/s) calculable from these equations. With their Newtonian ideas of absolute space and time firmly entrenched, most physicists thought that this speed was correct only in one special frame. This special frame was postulated to be in a state of absolute rest, and it was thought that electromagnetic waves were supported by an unseen medium called the ether, which is at rest in this frame. 

With this picture in mind, it is clear that if the Earth moves with respect to this special frame at a velocity V, then the speed of light 'with respect to the Earth can take any value from c -|v| to c + |v|, depending on the particular direction of v. This is indeed our intuitive understanding of how two velocities add. For example, if two objects have speeds V1 and V2 with respect to some
fixed frame, then we expect that their relative speed will be V1 - V2 if they are moving in the same direction, and V1 + V2 if they are moving in opposite directions. We have developed this 'intuition' based on our everyday experiences, and we have a gut feeling that it is correct.
However, we will see below that the correct relativistic law of 'addition of velocities' is somewhat different. 

In particular, the conflict became apparent where Maxwell’s Laws predicted a constant speed of light, independent of the speed of the source. Sound is like this; it moves through the air at the same speed, regardless of the speed of the source.

### The Galilean transformation
In Ref 3, a four-dimensional space-time coordinate system (t; x; y; z) ; which we will sometimes write as (t; ~x). And using the displacement representation of events to illustrate the Galilean transformation formulas. Neat.

### Michelson and Morley experiment:  
There were thus several attempts to detect the presence of this hypothetical ether or to show that the speed of light was frame dependent. The most famous experiment was done in 1887 by A A Michelson and E W Morley. They used an interferometer t~ study the speed of light along different directions and at different times of the year (when the orbital velocity of the Earth pointed along different directions). They concluded that the speed of light with respect to the Earth is always the same and does not depend on the relative motion of the Earth and the light wave. This observation proved that Maxwell's equations are valid in all (inertial) frames, and that there is no need to hypothesize a medium called the ether which is at rest in one preferred frame. 

It now seems obvious that, if Maxwell's equations had to retain their validity in all inertial frames, then our Newtonian notions of space and time need to be modified. However, while many of the best physicists of the time were aware of this inconsistency between Maxwell and Newton, it took almost two decades after the MichelsonMorley experiment and the genius of Einstein to come up with the right modification to Newtonian mechanics.

### The Lorentz transformation (from Ref 4:)
The Lorentz transformation had already been discovered by H A Lorentz in 1904 (and even earlier by W Voigt in 1887), except that he had not understood the significance of the time t'; he thought of it as some kind of a 'local' time which is needed in order to make sense of Maxwell's equations in frame B. Lorentz continued to believe in the notion of a preferred frame and an absolute time t.

Notice that the difference in travel times for the two arms of the Michelson interferometer is a factor of  
1 / sqroot(1 − u^2/c^2)  
Lorentz suggested that, because all of the electrons in all of the materials making up the interferometer (and everything else) should have to interact with the ether, moving through the ether might make materials contract by just this amount in the direction of motion, but not in transverse directions. (Fitzgerald had also noticed that this “fix” would work, but could not suggest what might cause it). In developing this idea further, Lorentz found that clocks that were moving through the ether
should run slowly too, by the same amount. He noticed that if, instead of the Galilean transformations, he made his substitutions (The Lorentz transformation) into the Maxwell equations, they became invariant!

### Poincar'e
To everyone else, naturally, Lorentz’s solution looked like an artificial fudge, invented just to solve this problem. People continued to try to discover an “ether wind”, and every time an explanation had to be made up as to why nature was “conspiring” to thwart these measurements. In the end, Poincar´e pointed out that a complete conspiracy is itself a law of nature; he proposed that there is such a law of nature, and that it is not possible to discover an ether wind by any experiment; that is, there is no way to determine an absolute velocity. Poincar´e’s principle of relativity (1904) states that:

The laws of physics should be the same in all reference frames which move in uniform motion with respect to one another.

### Einstein make two postulates:
1. All the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference. This postulate implies that there is no experiment whether based on the laws of mechanics or the laws of electromagnetism from which it is possible to determine whether or not a frame of reference is in a state of uniform motion.
2. The speed of light is independent of the motion of its source.

or

1. The laws of physics take the same form in all inertial frames.
2. The speed of light in vacuum is the same in all inertial frames.

Notes: Actually. the second postulate follows from the first since the laws of physics include Maxwell's
equations of electro magnetism which contain the speed of light.

### Summary of the history background of SR
The special theory of relativity based on following two postulates:
1. The laws of physics take the same form in all inertial frames, which is so called principle of relativity.
2. The speed of light in vacuum is the same in all inertial frames.

However those two postulates did not come from nowhere. Actually all the major pieces of the postulates are all in place, but simply not assembled together in meaningful way.

The basic idea of the principle of relativity is as early as at least Galilean/Newtonian time. The basic concept is not different from Einstein's at all, which implies to apply to all the laws of physics. However in practice, Galilean and Newtonian relativity has only been narrowly applied to the classic Newtonian mechanics. That is the all mechanics happen in the same way in all inertial frames of reference, with respect to Galilean transformation. The principle of relativity was actually verified by the invariant of classic Newtonian mechanics using Galilean transformation. In a period of more than 200 years before SR, few physicists has doubt about the correctness of the Galilean transformation and Newtonian mechanics.

Maxwell’s equations predicted that light waves should propagate at a finite speed c (about 300,000 km/s), but not sure refer to which frame of reference. The prevailing idea is that the speed of c is refer to the ether which is stationary with respect to the Newtonian absolute space (AS). The ether concept comes naturally from the logic comparison between mechanic waves such as sound and ocean wave prorogation. The fact is that the Maxwell’s equations is absolutely correct, but the assumption of ether and the absolute space was wrong. 

Michelson and Morley experiment and related experiments has not been able to prove the existence of ether, and show the speed of light is alway c, not matter in what references.

However the Maxwell’s equations is not invariant with Galilean transformation, which seems suggesting it does not obey the principal of relativity. More physicists think there are problem with Maxwell’s equations than Galilean transformation.

The Lorentz transformation, which is the correct transformation instead of Galilean transformation, is also formulated before SR. However Lorentz formulated the transformation in such a way to just make Maxwell’s equations invariant. The formulation of r in the transformation is based on the the difference in travel times for the two arms of the Michelson interferometer. Therefore Lorentz was not clear about the significance of the transformation in physics, and still assuming the existence of ether and absolute space. 

The Lorentz transformation is actually the correct transformation for the principal of relativity, which should replace the Galilean transformation, and naturally expands the principal of relativity to Maxwell's equations. However Lorentz did not realize that. Although Lorentz transformation makes Maxwell's equations invariant, it cannot resolve the conflict with Newtonian mechanics.
