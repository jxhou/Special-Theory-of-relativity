## The Historical Context Before the Special Theory of Relativity

The idea that a principle of relativity applies to the properties of the physical world is very old: it certainly predates Newton and Galileo,
but probably not as far back as Aristotle. 

What the principle of relativity essentially
states is the following:

The laws of physics take the same form in all frames of reference moving with constant velocity with respect to one another.

This is a statement that can be given a precise mathematical meaning: the laws of physics are expressed in terms of equations, and the form that these equations take in different reference frames moving with constant velocity with respect to one another can be calculated by use of transformation equations – the so-called Galilean transformation in the
case of Newtonian relativity. The principle of relativity then requires that the transformed equations have exactly the same form in all frames of reference, in other words that the physical laws are the same in all frames of reference.

Thus, quite generally the principle of relativity means that it is not possible, by considering any physical process whatsoever, to determine whether or not one or the other of the frames of references is ‘in motion’.

This principle of relativity was accepted (in somewhat simpler form i.e. with respect to the mechanical behaviour of bodies) by Newton and his successors.

All laws of nature appear to have
expression in mathematical form, so what the principle of relativity can be understood as saying is that the equations describing a law of nature take the same mathematical form in all inertial frames of reference.
